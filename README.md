#  Gung Code Test

## How 2 start 
Nothing special. Navigate to client/gung-project and start with ng serve

## Server 

Have not implemented anything except first initiation of files. I intended to fetch everything from a server to make it easier with asynchronous fetching but I ran out of time. I have however some basic experience with backend programming with node and express.

## Window

All of the functions from index.html make use of window. I had some struggle referencing window and couldn't solve this. After a lot of googling it seems as the way window works has changed between javascript versions and has also changed between angular versions. Eventually I solved it by just adding a //@ts-ignore

## Last words 

Really fun project. I learned alot since this is my first angular-project ever. I've learnt a lot and intend to learn a lot more.
