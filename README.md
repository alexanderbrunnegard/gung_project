#  Gung Code test

## How 2 start 
* Nothing special. Navigate to client/gung-project and start with ng serve

## Server 

Have not implemented anything but first initiation of files. I intended to fetch everything from a server to make it easier with asynchronous fetching but I ran out of time. I have however some basic experience with backend programming with node and express.

## Last words 

Really fun project. I learned alot since this is my first angular-project ever. I've learnt a lot and intend to learn a lot more.
